# Open Hacks

Hello there! I’m **Open Hacks**, the open source hackathon voting web application! Users are able to vote for hackathons that they enjoyed.

Let me introduce myself.

**Open Hacks** is a simple voting app where users must log in if they would like create and edit a hackathon. Open hacks was created by Matt Laguardia, aiming to provide a easy-to-use and simple platform.

This project was initially created in a week.
